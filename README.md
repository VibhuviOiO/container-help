# Container Help – Community Support for Docker, Podman & Containers

Welcome!  
This repository is a central place for anyone to raise **Docker / Podman / container-related issues**.  
If you're stuck with an error, troubleshooting a setup, or need a working configuration — open an issue and I’ll help you out.

I created this to make container support **open, accessible, and reusable**.  
Every solved issue becomes a reference for the next person.

## 🚀 How It Works

1. Open an issue describing your problem  
2. Add logs, screenshots, and your compose/K8s files if possible  
3. I’ll review when I get time  
4. You’ll get:
   - guidance  
   - fixes  
   - improved configs  
   - or a full working example pushed back to this repo

## 🐳 What You Can Ask

You can raise issues related to:

- Docker  
- Podman  
- Kubernetes (basic workloads)  
- Compose or podman-compose  
- Image building  
- Container networking  
- Registry issues  
- Observability / Logging inside containers  
- Any containerized application setup (.NET, Java, databases, services, etc.)

If it runs in a container, you can raise it here.

## 📂 Why This Repo Exists

Because many people ask for help in DMs or chats, and problems get lost.  
By keeping everything public:

- Anyone can learn from previous issues  
- Others can contribute solutions  
- I can provide better, reusable help  
- We build a community-driven troubleshooting knowledge base

---

## 📝 Before You Create an Issue

Please include:

- Description of the error  
- Exact command / docker-compose / podman config  
- Logs or stack trace  
- Your OS + container runtime (Docker or Podman)  
- Steps to reproduce (if known)

This helps speed up debugging.
